## PARAGRAPH_PRE_Basic python programming
### course name : intro to self-control
#### courses come from https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013
#### describe: my notes is prepare for people who have owned basic python programming skills.so  I will use more general way to organize this knowledge in my markdown notes.

#### As for beginner(like freshmen or even more young),I suggest you to watch some channels in coursera([Coursera | Online Courses & Credentials From Top Educators. Join for Free](https://www.coursera.org/)). If you are not really better in English,I recommend you to learn basic python knowledge in [Python教程 - 廖雪峰的官方网站 (liaoxuefeng.com)](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/1016959663602400/)

#### This module will show you how to program in a  interactive way,take it easy,it's just a small test.

### LESSON1:intro to this module

#### INTRO

.... python NB!

#### WARNING: THREE ESSENTIAL POINTS IN PYTHON PROGRAMMING

- python is case sensitive

  is different with SQL

- **spacing is important in python**

- Use error message to help you learn how to write code

#### OVERVIEW

- **lesson1:**  intro
- **lesson2:**  data types and operators
- **lesson3:**  control flow
- **lesson4:**  function definition,variable scope and so on.
- **lesson5:**  scripting

### LESSON2: data types and operators

#### calculating operator

*operator use to calculate.

#### variable 

- left is variable,right is the value

- like:

  ```python
  my_population = 74
  ```

  but this value not equal to this variable(my population)

- use **routine alphabet,digit,and underline** to name variable

- WARNING: avoid to use keywords in python

  | False  | class    | finally | is       | return |
  | ------ | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
  | None   | continue | for     | lambda   | try    |
  | True   | def      | from    | nonlocal | while  |
  | and    | del      | global  | not      | with   |
  | as     | elif     | if      | or       | yield  |
  | assert | else     | import  | pass     |        |
  | break  | except   | in      | raise    |        |

- we recommend use lowercase to name variable,like "snake case"

  ```python
  my_height = 58 #recommend
  MYLONG = 40 #hum....
  MyLat = 105 #all right
  ```

#### assigning operator

like `+=` and so on......

#### int and float
- use correct type to express variable
- like use int to express count for people,or obj,use float to express others
- division by zero?
- will happen `ZeroDivisionError `mistake

#### Boolean,logical,comparing operator
hold on,it's too easy.

#### string

hold on,it's too easy.

- use \ to divide ' ' in string
- len(string) 
- (string * n)
- string[0]

- **function in string**

  

#### Basic Data Structure in python

If you want to use python more fluently,I recommend you to practice in these websites....

#### TYPE & Type Conversion

- use type() function,you can judge the type of variable
